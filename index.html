                    <br>
                    <p>Programming is something that is used in every video game, or social media platform, and everything on the internet. Everything on your phone, and on your computer. Programming is everywhere. And it is becoming bigger every day. More and more jobs are opening up all over the world looking for programmers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 style="font-weight:bolder;">What does it take to become a programmer?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Becoming an amateur programmer is quite simple, it just takes some time and dedication. It is almost as simple as looking up tutorials on youtube, or finding tutorials on a wiki, or even a site like w3schools.com. w3schools is a widespread business with tons of tutorials and different methods to teach you how to code. And the best part is it's free! On the other hand, becoming a professional will take a little bit more work, it would be in your best interest to take classes in high school like, Computer Applications, Web Development, etc. But to become a programmer, most business's require a Bachelors degree in order to qualify. This can be a struggle for those who are struggling financially.</p>
